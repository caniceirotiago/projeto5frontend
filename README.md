## Description

The frontend for the "Task Manager" project is designed to deliver a dynamic and responsive user experience. Built with React.js, this application leverages modern web technologies to provide an intuitive and interactive interface.

This repository contains the frontend source code for the "Task Manager" application, developed as part of the 11th edition of the "Acertar o Rumo" program at the University of Coimbra. This project is the final one in an incremental multiple projects strategy. All other incremental projects where built in a team of two, except for project 5 , wich was bult by a single developer. This project received the highest grade. 

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and intuitive web application to facilitate the management of an Scrum based task manager. The application aims to provide a centralized environment for organizing, coordinating, and monitoring innovative projects, promoting team collaboration and optimizing the use of available resources.

## Technologies Used

React.js: Utilized as the main library for building the user interface. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable and high-performance components, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.

React Router: Manages routing within the application, enabling efficient navigation between different pages without the need for full page reloads. This ensures smooth transitions for users.

CSS: Employed for detailed and aesthetic styling of interface elements, allowing for a customized look and feel of the application.

React Intl: Integrated for internationalization, supporting multiple languages and cultures to ensure global accessibility and an inclusive user experience.

WebSockets: Facilitates real-time communication between the frontend and backend, enabling instant updates and interactive features within the user interface.
